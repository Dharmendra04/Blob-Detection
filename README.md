# Blob-Detection
#Detecting blob using Image processing (Open CV)
In this project, Blob Detection and Contours are used to find the blobs and the outer wrap. A blob is a group of connected pixels with the same properties, such as color, intensity, or texture. Blob detection algorithms are used for various applications, including object recognition, motion detection, and image segmentation.
